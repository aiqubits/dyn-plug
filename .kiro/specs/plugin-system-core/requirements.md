# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DynPlug Plugin System Core provides a dynamic plugin architecture for loading and executing external modules at runtime in Rust. This system enables modular service architecture with runtime extensibility, allowing plugins to be loaded from shared libraries, managed through CLI and HTTP API interfaces, and configured through YAML-based configuration files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define a plugin interface, so that I can create standardized plugins that can be loaded dynamically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a plugin trait is defined THEN the system SHALL provide a standard interface with name, version, and execute methods
2. WHEN a plugin is implemented THEN it SHALL be able to return metadata about itself
3. WHEN a plugin executes THEN it SHALL accept input parameters and return results
4. IF a plugin fails during execution THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to load plugins dynamically from shared libraries, so that I can extend functionality without recompiling the main application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL scan the plugins directory for shared libraries
2. WHEN a shared library is found THEN the system SHALL attempt to load it as a plugin
3. WHEN a plugin is loaded THEN it SHALL be registered in the plugin registry
4. IF a plugin fails to load THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other plugins
5. WHEN plugins are loaded THEN they SHALL be available for execution and management

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage plugins through a CLI interface, so that I can list, enable, disable, and configure plugins from the command line.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the list command THEN the system SHALL display all available plugins with their status
2. WHEN I run the enable command with a plugin name THEN the system SHALL enable the specified plugin
3. WHEN I run the disable command with a plugin name THEN the system SHALL disable the specified plugin
4. WHEN I run the execute command with a plugin name and parameters THEN the system SHALL execute the plugin and return results
5. IF an invalid plugin name is provided THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a remote client, I want to manage plugins through an HTTP API, so that I can integrate plugin management into other systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs in service mode THEN it SHALL expose HTTP endpoints for plugin management
2. WHEN I send a GET request to /plugins THEN the system SHALL return a list of all plugins
3. WHEN I send a POST request to /plugins/{name}/execute THEN the system SHALL execute the specified plugin
4. WHEN I send a PUT request to /plugins/{name}/enable THEN the system SHALL enable the specified plugin
5. WHEN I send a PUT request to /plugins/{name}/disable THEN the system SHALL disable the specified plugin
6. IF an HTTP request is malformed THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure plugins through YAML files, so that I can persist plugin settings and system configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from config.yaml if it exists
2. WHEN plugin configuration is updated THEN it SHALL be persisted to the configuration file
3. WHEN a plugin is enabled/disabled THEN its status SHALL be saved in the configuration
4. IF the configuration file is missing THEN the system SHALL create a default configuration
5. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL use default values and log warnings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create plugins as separate crates, so that I can develop and build plugins independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a plugin crate THEN it SHALL be configured as a cdylib crate type
2. WHEN I implement a plugin THEN it SHALL use the register_plugin! macro for registration
3. WHEN I build a plugin THEN it SHALL produce a shared library in the target/plugins directory
4. WHEN the build script runs THEN it SHALL compile all plugins and deploy them to the correct location
5. IF a plugin has compilation errors THEN the build SHALL report the errors clearly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the system to handle errors gracefully, so that one failing plugin doesn't crash the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a plugin fails to load THEN the system SHALL continue loading other plugins
2. WHEN a plugin execution fails THEN the system SHALL return an error without crashing
3. WHEN the system encounters invalid configuration THEN it SHALL use defaults and continue
4. WHEN network errors occur in service mode THEN the system SHALL log errors and maintain service
5. IF critical system components fail THEN the system SHALL shut down gracefully

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging throughout the system, so that I can debug issues and monitor system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs any operation THEN it SHALL log appropriate information
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
3. WHEN plugins are loaded or unloaded THEN these events SHALL be logged
4. WHEN HTTP requests are processed THEN they SHALL be logged with request details
5. IF log level is configured THEN only messages at or above that level SHALL be output
